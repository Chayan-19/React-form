# React-form

This is a form based on react which is used to send automated emails to the person filling up his/her details.

It has a nodejs backend which is integrated with Amazon Simple Mail Service and cron-jobs to send automated emails.

Users can schedule the time, date and day for the emails by using the cron scheduler.
